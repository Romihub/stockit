# Lesson Learnt - AI Service Setup

1. Virtual Environment Activation on Windows:
   - Use forward slashes: venv/Scripts/activate
   - Instead of backslashes: venv\Scripts\activate

2. Scikit-learn Version Update:
   - Updated from 1.0.2 to 1.3.0 to resolve Cython compilation errors
   - Compatible with numpy 1.26.0, pandas 2.1.1, tensorflow 2.13.0

3. Running Service Directly:
   - Create virtual environment: python -m venv venv
   - Activate: venv/Scripts/activate
   - Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
   - Run service: python run.py

4. Platform-Specific Dependencies:
   - For Windows with Python 3.12+, use:
     scikit-learn==1.3.0; platform_system == "Windows" and python_version >= "3.12"
   - This ensures pre-built wheels are used instead of building from source

5. Additional Setup Requirements:
   - Install Microsoft C++ Build Tools through Visual Studio:
     * Select "C++ build tools" workload
     * Ensure "MSVC v142 - VS 2019 C++ x64/x86 build tools" and "Windows 10 SDK" are checked

6. Dependency Updates:
   - Update pip and setuptools:
     python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
   - Updated package versions:
     * fastapi==0.100.0
     * numpy<2.0.0,>=1.26.0
     * tensorflow==2.18.0
     * httpx==0.27.0
     * pydantic>=2.9.0

7. Known Issues:
    - Numpy version conflict warning:
      * blis 1.0.1 requires numpy<3.0.0,>=2.0.0
      * thinc 8.3.2 requires numpy<2.1.0,>=2.0.0
      * Current numpy version: 1.26.4
      * Monitor for potential issues but should not prevent application from running

8. API Rate Limiting and Data Fetching:
    - Polygon API Limitations:
      * market_cap field not directly sortable in /v3/reference/tickers endpoint
      * Rate limits hit when requesting too many stocks at once
    - Optimizations:
      * Reduce initial request size from 1000 to 100 stocks
      * Implement progressive loading: start with top 20, then fetch more as needed
      * Cache results for 24 hours to reduce API calls
      * Use batch processing with 5 stocks per batch and 1-second delays
